my first p5.js sketch

Fire Brush
Start with a new p5 sketch.

 Draw a circle when the mouse is pressed
 The diameter of the circle should be random between 10px and 30px
 Use the red, green, blue and alpha channel to define the fill color
 The green and alpha channel of the color depends on the size of the circle
 If the diameter is smaller than 20px
 The green portion of the color should be 0
 The opacity of the color should be between 10 and 40
 If the diameter is larger or equal than 20px
 The green portion of the color should be between 100 and 200
 The opacity of the color should be between 40 and 70
 The blue channel is always 0
 The red channel is random between 200 and 255
 The x and y coordinates of the circle is based on the current mouse position but it also includes randomness from -20px to +20px
